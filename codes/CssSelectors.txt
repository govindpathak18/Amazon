1) DOM=>Document Object Model.
    The DOM is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a webpage as a tree of objects, where each element (like headings, paragraphs, links, etc.) is an object that can be accessed and manipulated using languages like JavaScript.
2) SELECTORS
1. Universal : *{...} --> selects evrything on the web page
2. Type : p{ }, h1{ }, img{ } --> selects a type of element
3. Class : .class{ } --> selects  element with a given class , most common
4. Id : #id{ } --> selects Id given to an element
5. Attribute : input[type="text"]{ } -->selects an elementbased on its attribute, eg. input with attribute text is being selected here
6. Descendents : h1 p{ } --> all p that are Descendents of h1 are being selected
7. Child : h1>p{ } --> all p that are direct child (first Descendents)  of h1 are being selected
8. Pseudo-class : class:hover{ }
9. Pseudo-element : p::first-letter{ }
10. Grouping : p,h1,a{ } --> selects multiple elements
there are few more SELECTORS that are not often used...
